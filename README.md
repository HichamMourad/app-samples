# Mortgage App

This project is a simple WebSphere web app that accepts mortgage request information
and determines approval.

There are two built in users; bob and deb.  Any password will work.  Bob always gets
his loans approved, and deb never does.

# Move to Channel and Subscription framework

Starting with version 1.0.3 the mortgage app has moved to the Channel and Subscription framework in order to run on MCM.
